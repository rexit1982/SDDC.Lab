          ================================ Pod Connectivity Issue ================================

            Issue: Unable to ping Pod-Router's management interface from the Ansible Controller.
                   This is usually caused by the Pod-Router not having been properly configured.

            The address we attempted to ping was {{ Nested_Router.Interface.Management.IPv4.Address }}.

          In the Pod's current state, the deployment of vCenter Server WILL FAIL after about 30+ minutes.
          For that reason, please abort this deployment by

                                    PRESSING CONTROL-C, FOLLOWED BY THE LETTER "A"

          Once the script has aborted, investigate why there isn't reachability to the Pod-Router's management
          interface.  The three likely causes are:
            1) The VyOS Pod-Router did not deploy propertly.
            2) The Pod-Router did not get properly configured.  In the past, we have seen this been caused
               by VyOS releasing a new version of the VyOS ISO that doesn't process all of the commands.
            3) Dynamic routing protocol(s) did not establish neighbor relationships, and as such, the
               Pod-Router's management interface didn't get advertised to the physical Layer-3 switch.
